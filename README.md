# AGP_plate_adapter
This repository contains 3D models of plate adapters for Thermo Fisher AB-2396 Armadillo 96-well PCR plate. They enable the transfer of supernatant from one plate to another. Necessary for AGP glycopeptide analysis as in  doi: 10.1074/mcp.RA120.002433.

# Instructions for 3d printing
These designs were printed on the Prusa i3 mk2 3d printer. The fillament used was PLA, with the layer height set at 0.15 mm. Supports were auto-generated where necessary using the PrusaSlicer software.

# Instructions for use
The PCR plate containing precipitated proteins with the supernatant we wish to separate out is plaed on the bench. On top of it we place an inverted clean PCR plate so that the corresponding wells are in direct contact. 3d printed plate clips are placed in the 8 holes on the plates so as to fix them in place. To apply pressure and keep the plates in contact throughout the 96 wells a 3d printed double leaf spring is used. First at the center an adapter is placed so that the spring has more even area to push against, then the springs are placed in the grooves and finally the ends are cliped in firmly. This is then placed in a centrifuge inverted so that with small G-forces the liquid is transfered into the clean PCR plate.
